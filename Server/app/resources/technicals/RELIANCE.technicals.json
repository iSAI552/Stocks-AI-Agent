Indicators (RSI ~69, MACD positive, ADX strong) show momentum but caution due to near overbought levels. A channel is forming between ₹1,480–₹1,560; breakout targets ₹1,574–₹1,596. Long-term support at ₹1,094 is critical; breach could trigger a trend reversal. Overall setup favors upside with minor pullback risks."
